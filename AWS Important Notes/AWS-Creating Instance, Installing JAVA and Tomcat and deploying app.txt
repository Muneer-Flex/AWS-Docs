To install tomcat:

	Download Tomcat:: this will download the tomcat .tar file
		wget http://www.gtlib.gatech.edu/pub/apache/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.5.34/bin/apache-tomcat-8.5.34.tar.gz

	ls -- this will list the downloaded tomcat tar file
	
	Install tomcat
		tar xvfz <downloaded tomcat file name with extension>

To start tomcat server		
	Go to bin folder of tomcat & execute startup.sh
	
	./startup.sh
	
To test tomcat is up & running
	 wget http://localhost:8080 -- will be successfull
	 
	 try to open tomcat through browser, it will get failed
	 
Facing conection refused with above command? this is because we have logged in as user.. so login as super user & start the server again to avoid this issue

sudo su

./startup.sh

try .. wget http://localhost:8080 -- successfull, with status as 200 OK.

	but try to open tomcat through browser, it will get failed
	
Still tomcat is not up? this is because of firewall in AWS.. go to AWS - EC2 Management Console - Launch Instance page (where we copied instance & DNS name)
.. last tab Security Group .. click on that & click inbound tab .. edit .. add rule .. type :: custom TCP rule, port :: 8080 .. remaining as it is.

now refresh & see, tomcat will  be up & running in browser..

try to deploy any war file through admin/manager console, it will prompt for user name & password..

so, edit the tomcat-user.xml file inside conf folder of tomcat.. provide username, password & assign roles to that user...

shutdown & restart the server again... username & password should work now....

Still facing authentication issue, then go to webapps/manager/web.xml file & comment the security constraints tag...

shutdown & restart the server again.. now username/password will not be prompted
